# What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source operating system kernel** developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  
A *kernel* is the core part of an OS — it manages hardware, memory, processes, and system calls.

Linux by itself is only a kernel.  
To form a complete operating system, it is combined with:
- System utilities  
- Shells  
- Package managers  
- Libraries  
- Desktop environments (optional)

These complete systems are called **Linux distributions** (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).

## 🔥 Why Linux Kernel is Important in DevOps
- All cloud servers (AWS EC2, GCP, Azure) run Linux-based systems  
- Docker containers rely on Linux kernel features (cgroups, namespaces)  
- Kubernetes clusters run on Linux nodes  
- Most automation tools are built for Linux environments  
- Linux kernel is stable, secure, and optimized for servers

## 🧱 Key Responsibilities of the Linux Kernel
- **Process Management** (scheduling, running, killing processes)  
- **Memory Management** (RAM allocation, swap)  
- **Device Management** (drivers for disks, keyboards, network)  
- **File System Handling**  
- **Networking** (TCP/IP stack)  
- **Security** (permissions, user management, system calls)

## 📌 Summary
Linux is **not an operating system** — it is the **kernel** that forms the foundation of many operating systems called distributions.

Learning Linux commands, filesystem, permissions, and processes is essential for DevOps engineering.
