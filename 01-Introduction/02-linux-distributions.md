# Linux Distributions (Distros)

A Linux distribution (distro) is a complete operating system built using the **Linux kernel** plus additional software like:
- Shell (Bash, Zsh)
- Package manager (APT, YUM, Pacman)
- Utilities (coreutils)
- System services
- Optional GUI

Different distros exist because they target different use-cases such as servers, desktops, security, or development.
